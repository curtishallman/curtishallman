Learning the Impact of Covid-19 in Canada with Artificial Intelligence

During the early months of 2020 the outbreak of Covid-19
began and individuals around the world saw changes in their
daily habits and health. The ‘Learning the Impact of Covid-19
in Canada with Artificial Intelligence’ research report will
attempt to identify how different factors influence mental
health, find possible solutions to help improve mental health,
and provide information on which machine learning models and
algorithms are best for predicting mental health outcomes.
Using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and
Support Vector Machine, inferences can be made on outputs of
the given data which provide insights into how mental health is
affected and strategies that can be used to improve one’s mental
health.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. Random Forest (Sci-learn Kit)
2. Support Vector Machine (Sci-learn Kit)
3. Naive Bayes (Sci-learn Kit)

Accuracy Achieved: 
- Substance Abuse: 94% (Random Forest)
- Alcohol Abuse: 85% (Random Forest)
- Change in Weekly Habits: 96% (Random Forest)
